comment: This phenotype is not necessarily accompanied by overgrowth of a tissue - there may be more cells in an otherwise normal volume of tissue. It is not necessarily due to an increase in cell growth -it may be the result of an increase in the division rate at normal growth rates.  It may not even be due to an increase in the cell division rate - a reduced rate of cell death while the division rate is normal could also achieve it.

def: "Dominant phenotype consisting of short slender bristles and delayed development. Homozygotes are cell lethal." [FlyBase:FBrf0066905]
comment: The phenotype may be a general result of mutations in essential components of the protein synthesis pathway, as a number of Minutes encode ribosomal proteins. In an animal that is heterozygous for a Minute mutation, cells with two wild-type alleles of the affected gene have a growth advantage. Many developmental studies take advantage of this fact to give somatic clones a growth advantage. The term 'Minute' should not be used to annotate the resulting phenotypes.

comment: Melanotic capsules are formed around foreign bodies in wild-type animals as part of the immune response, for example as a protection against parasitoid wasps. Some, but not all melanotic mass phenotypes involve ectopic activation of this immune response. While melanotic masses are commonly referred to as melanotic tumors in the historical literature, this is a misnomer as they are rarely neoplastic.

If a difference in "oviposition rate" is measured by authors as a proxy for sterility/fertility, it would be better to use the terms "sterile", "semi-sterile", or "semi-fertile", as appropriate.
