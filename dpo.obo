It is not necessarily due to an increase in cell growth -it may be the result of an increase in the division rate at normal growth rates.

comment: This term should only be used to report defects specifically in oviposition, as opposed to an overall loss of fertility. It is not possible to observe an oviposition abnormality if eggs are not being produced. If a difference in "oviposition rate" is measured by authors as a proxy for sterility/fertility, it would be better to use the terms "sterile", "semi-sterile", or "semi-fertile", as appropriate.

comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.
