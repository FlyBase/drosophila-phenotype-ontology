This placode invaginates during stages 12-13, forming a deep pouch of approximately 85 cells (Green et al., 1993). Its ventral lip segregates from the rest of the primordium and develops into the Bolwig organ (Green et al., 1993). The remainder of the placode, which will form the optic lobe, detaches from the surface of the embryo and attaches to the lateral brain, maintaining a tubular appearance until larval hatching (Green et al., 1993). Its anterior and posterior domains will become the larval inner and outer optic anlage, respectively (Chang et al., 2001).
